This document records the code specification for the Triangle programming language.

## Code Functions

```
  run : Program -> Instruction*

  execute : Command -> Instruction*

  evaluate : Expression -> Instruction*

  elaborate : Declaration -> Instruction*

  fetch : Vname -> Instruction*
  assign : Vname -> Instruction*
  fetch-address : Vname -> Instruction*

```

Expected behaviour of code functions:

```
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  | Phrase class | Code Function | Effect of generated code                                                                             |
  |-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Program      | run P         | Run the program P and then halt, starting and stopping with an empty stack.                          |
  | Command      | execute C     | Execute the command C, possibly updating variables, but neither expanding nor contracting the stack. |
  | Expression   | evaluate E    | Evaluate the expression E, pushing its result on the stack, but having no other effects.             |
  | V-name       | fetch V       | Push the value of the variable or value V onto the stack.                                            |
  | V-name       | assign V      | Pop a value from the stack top, and store it in the variable V                                       |
  | Declaration  | elaborate D   | Elaborate the declaration D, expanding the stack for any variables or constants declared therein     |

### V-name


  * KnownValue - a value bound in a constant declaration, whose RHS is a literal.

  * UnknownValue - a value bound in a const declaration, whose RHS contains entities evaluated at runtime. Also an argument value bound to a constant parameter.

  * KnownAddress - an address allocated in a variable declaration. Each such address is represented by a (level, displacement) pair.

  * UnknownAddress - an argument address bound to a variable parameter.

  * KnownRoutine - a routine (user-defined) bound in a procedure or function declaration.

  * UnknownRoutine - describes a closure argument bound to a procedure or function parameter.

  * PrimitiveRoutine - a primitive routine defined by the TAM.

  * EqualityRoutine - a special primitive routine that checks for equality of (same type) values of any type.
  
  * Field - describes a field of a record.

  * Type representation - describes a type. Every type has a known constant size.
